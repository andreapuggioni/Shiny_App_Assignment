```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


## What is it?

A web app made for learning the different ggplot geom layouts

## 16 graphs

Spectacular visualizations with violin, jitter, smooth and many others


```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x=cyl, y=hwy, colour=model)) + facet_wrap(~mpg$manufacturer) + geom_violin()
            g
```

## How it was made?

With R and ggplot2 package, of course!

I'll show you the code of the previous slide:

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x=cyl, y=hwy, colour=model))
g <- g + facet_wrap(~mpg$manufacturer)
g <- g + geom_violin()
     g
```




## The Outcomes

Have a look by yourself and have fun learning R!
